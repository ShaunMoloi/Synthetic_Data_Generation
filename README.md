Generating Synthetic Data

Real-world domains are associated with numerous aspects of complexity (e.g., missing data, imbalanced data, chaotic data), but one of the most prevalent is heterogeneous (or "mixed") data, i.e., data that contains both numeric and categorical characteristics.

As each feature type may have its own inherent characteristics, heterogeneous data presents additional obstacles to the process of generating synthetic data.
ydata-synthetic has recently introduced a Streamlit app for synthetic data generation that enables a full data flow from data input to profiling the newly generated synthetic data.
